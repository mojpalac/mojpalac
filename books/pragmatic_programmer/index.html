<h3 id="1-its-your-life">1 It’s Your Life</h3>
<p>It is your life. You own it. You run it. You create it. Many developers we talk to are frustrated. Their concerns are
varied. Some feel they’re stagnating in their job, others that technology has passed them by. Folks feel they are
underappreciated, or underpaid, or that their teams are toxic. Maybe they want to move to Asia, or Europe, or work from
home.
And the answer we give is always the same.
And the answer we give is always the same.
<em>Why can’t you change it?</em></p>
<p>Does your work environment suck? Is your job boring? Try to fix it. But don’t try forever. As Martin Fowler says, "you
can change your organization or change your organization."</p>
<h3 id="2-the-cat-ate-my-source-code">2 The Cat Ate My Source Code</h3>
<p>Team Trust - is absolutely essential for creativity and collaboration according to the research literature [e.g. (
research) [https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fapl0000110].
In a healthy environment based in trust, you can safely speak your mind, present your ideas, and rely on your team
members who can in turn rely on you.</p>
<p>Take Responsibility - When you do accept the responsibility for an outcome, you should expect to be held accountable for
it. When you make a mistake (as we all do) or an error in judgment, admit it honestly and try to offer options.
It is up to you to provide solutions, not excuses.</p>
<p>Before you approach anyone to tell them why something can’t be done, is late, or is broken, stop and listen to yourself.
Talk to the rubber duck on your monitor, or the cat. Does your excuse sound reasonable, or stupid? How’s it going to
sound to your boss?
Run through the conversation in your mind. What is the other person likely to say? Will they ask, "Have you tried this…"
or "Didn’t you consider that?" How will you respond? Before you go and tell them the bad news, is there anything else
you can try? Sometimes, you just know what they are going to say, so save them the trouble.</p>

<h3 id="3-software-entropy">3 Software Entropy</h3>
<p><strong>Entropy</strong> is a term from physics that refers to the amount of "disorder" in a system.
it might be called, by the more optimistic term, "technical debt," with the implied notion that they’ll pay it back
someday. They probably won’t.</p>
<p>In inner cities, some buildings are beautiful and clean, while others are rotting hulks. Why? Researchers in the field
of crime and urban decay discovered a fascinating trigger mechanism, one that very quickly turns a clean, intact,
inhabited building into a smashed and abandoned derelict.[5] A broken window. One broken window, left unrepaired for any
substantial length of time, instills in the inhabitants of the building a sense of abandonment—a sense that the powers
that be don’t care about the building. So another window gets broken. People start littering. Graffiti appears. Serious
structural damage begins. In a relatively short span of time, the building becomes damaged beyond the owner’s desire to
fix it, and the sense of abandonment becomes reality. Why would that make a difference? Psychologists have done
studies[6] that show hopelessness can be contagious. Think of the flu virus in close quarters. Ignoring a clearly broken
situation reinforces the ideas that perhaps nothing can be fixed, that no one cares, all is doomed; all negative
thoughts which can spread among team members, creating a vicious spiral.</p>
<h4 id="tip-5-dont-live-with-broken-windows">Tip 5 Don’t Live with Broken Windows</h4>
<p>Don’t leave "broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired. Fix each one as soon as it is
discovered. If there is insufficient time to fix it properly, then board it up. Perhaps you can comment out the
offending code, or display a "Not Implemented" message, or substitute dummy data instead. Take some action to prevent
further damage and to show that you’re on top of the situation. We’ve seen clean, functional systems deteriorate pretty
quickly.
You may be thinking that no one has the time to go around cleaning up all the broken glass of a project. If so, then
you’d better plan on getting a dumpster, or moving to another neighborhood. Don’t let entropy win.</p>
<h3 id="4-stone-soup-and-boiled-frogs">4 Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs</h3>
<p>Stone soup - allegory to the soldiers coming back from war stopping at village hoping for some food.
Villagers didn't want to share the food.
The soldiers boiled a pot of water and carefully placed three stones into it. The amazed villagers came out to watch.
Once villagers started to seeing what's happening one by one get more interested and ask about it, in return they hear
from soldiers.
"The stone soup is good as it is, but some say it tests better when we add X" which cause villagers to start to share
their supply with soldiers.
Eventually they had produced a large pot of steaming soup. The soldiers removed the stones, and they sat down with the
entire village to enjoy the first square meal any of them had eaten in months.</p>
<p>The soldiers act as a catalyst, bringing the village together, so they can jointly produce something that they couldn’t
have done by themselves—a synergistic result. Eventually everyone wins.</p>

<p>Work out what you can reasonably ask for. Develop it well. Once you’ve got it, show people, and let them marvel. Then
say "of course, it would be better if we added…" Pretend it’s not important. Sit back and wait for them to start asking
you to add the functionality you originally wanted. People find it easier to join an ongoing success. Show them a
glimpse of the future, and you’ll get them to rally around.</p>

<h3 id="7-communicate">7 Communicate!</h3>
<p>Treat English (or whatever your native tongue may be) <strong>as just another programming language</strong>. Write natural language
as you would write code: honor the DRY principle, ETC, automation, and so on. (We discuss the DRY and ETC design
principles in the next chapter.)</p>
<p><strong>Know Your Audience</strong> - By making the appropriate pitch to each group, you’ll get them all excited about your project.
As with all forms of communication, the trick here is to gather feedback. Don’t just wait for questions: ask for them.
Look at body language, and facial expressions. One of the Neuro Linguistic Programming presuppositions is "The meaning
of your communication is the response you get." Continuously improve your knowledge of your audience as you communicate.</p>
<p><strong>Know What You Want to Say</strong>
Fiction writers often plot out their books in detail before they start, but people writing technical documents are often
happy to sit down at a keyboard, enter:</p>
<pre><code>  1. Introduction 
</code></pre>
<p>Plan what you want to say. Write an outline. Then ask yourself, "Does this communicate what I want to
express to my audience in a way that works for them?" Refine it until it does.</p>
<p><strong>Choose Your Moment</strong>
Catch a manager who’s just been given a hard time by her boss because some source code got lost, and you’ll have a more
receptive listener to your ideas on source code repositories. Make what you’re saying relevant in time, as well as in
content. Sometimes all it takes is the simple question, "Is this a good time to talk about…?"</p>
<p><strong>Make It Look Good</strong>
Too many developers (and their managers) concentrate solely on content when producing written documents. We think this
is a mistake. Any chef (or watcher of the Food Network) will tell you that you can slave in the kitchen for hours only
to ruin your efforts with poor presentation.
There is no excuse today for producing poor-looking printed documents.</p>
<p><strong>Involve Your Audience</strong>
If possible, involve your readers with early drafts of your document. Get their feedback, and pick their brains. You’ll
build a good working relationship, and you’ll probably produce a better document in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Be a Listener</strong>
There’s one technique that you must use if you want people to listen to you: listen to them. Even if this is a situation
where you have all the information, even if this is a formal meeting with you standing in front of 20 suits—if you don’t
listen to them, they won’t listen to you. Encourage people to talk by asking questions, or ask them to restate the
discussion in their own words. Turn the meeting into a dialog, and you’ll make your point more effectively. Who knows,
you might even learn something.</p>
<p><strong>Get Back to People</strong>
Always respond to emails and voicemails, even if the response is simply "I’ll get back to you later".
communicate. The more effective that communication, the more influential you become.</p>
<p><strong>Keep code and documentation together</strong>
Writing documentation can be made easier by not duplicating effort or wasting time, and by keeping documentation close
at hand—in the code itself. In fact, we want to apply all of our pragmatic principles to documentation as well as to
code.</p>
<p>It’s easy to produce good-looking documentation from the comments in source code, and we recommend adding comments to
modules and exported functions to give other developers a leg up when they come to use it.
Restrict your non-API commenting to discussing why something is done, its purpose and its goal. The code already
shows how it is done, so commenting on this is redundant—and is a violation of the DRY principle.</p>
<p><strong>Online Communication tips</strong></p>
<p>Our tips are simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proofread before you hit <strong>SEND</strong>.</li>
<li>Check your spelling and look for any accidental autocorrect mishaps.</li>
<li>Keep the format simple and clear.</li>
<li>Keep quoting to a minimum.</li>
<li>No one likes to receive back their own 100-line email with "I agree" tacked on. If you’re quoting other people’s
  email, be sure to attribute it, and quote it inline (rather than as an attachment). Same when quoting on social media
  platforms.</li>
<li>Don’t flame or act like a troll unless you want it to come back and haunt you later. If you wouldn’t say it to
  someone’s face, don’t say it online.</li>
<li>Check your list of recipients before sending. It’s become a cliché to criticize the boss over departmental email
  without realizing that the boss is on the cc list. Better yet, don’t criticize the boss over email.</li>
</ul>
<p>As countless large corporations and politicians have discovered, email and social media posts are forever. Try to give
the same attention and care to email as you would to any written memo or report.</p>

<h4 id="tip-14-good-design-is-easier-to-change-than-bad-design">Tip 14 Good Design Is Easier to Change Than Bad Design</h4>
<p>ETC - easier to change - principle
every design principle out there is a special case of ETC.
Why is decoupling good? Because by isolating concerns we make each easier to change. ETC.
Why is the single responsibility principle useful? Because a change in requirements is mirrored by a change in just one
module. ETC.
Why is naming important? Because good names make code easier to read, and you have to read it to change it. ETC!</p>
<p><strong>ETC Is a Value, Not a Rule</strong></p>
<p>Deliberately ask yourself "did the thing I just did make the overall system easier or harder to change?" Do it when you
save a file. Do it when you write a test. Do it when you fix a bug.
It assumes that a person can tell which of many paths will be easier to change in the future. Much of the time, common
sense will be correct, and you can make an educated guess.
If you're still not sure which is the best solution, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to make the code you write replaceable</li>
<li>treat this as a way to develop instincts.Note the situation in your engineering day book: the choices you have, and
  some guesses about change. Leave a tag in the source. Then, later, when this code has to change, you’ll be able to
  look back and give yourself feedback. It might help the next time you reach a similar fork in the road.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="9-dry-the-devils-of-duplication">9 DRY - The Devils of Duplication</h3>
<p>Most people assume that maintenance begins when an application is released, that maintenance means fixing bugs and
enhancing features. We think these people are wrong. Programmers are constantly in maintenance mode. Our understanding
changes day by day. New requirements arrive and existing requirements evolve as we’re heads-down on the project. Perhaps
the environment changes. Whatever the reason, maintenance is not a discrete activity, but a routine part of the entire
development process.</p>
<p>We feel that the only way to develop software reliably, and to make our developments easier to understand and maintain,
is to follow what we call the <strong>DRY principle</strong>:</p>
<p>DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself - <em>Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation
within a system.</em></p>
<p>Don’t copy-and-paste lines of source is only a part of DRY.</p>
<p>DRY is about the duplication of knowledge, of intent. It’s about expressing the same thing in two different places,
possibly in two totally different ways.</p>
<p>Here’s the acid test: when some single facet of the code has to change, do you find yourself making that change in
multiple places, and in multiple different formats? Do you have to change code and documentation, or a database schema
and a structure that holds it, or…? If so, your code isn’t DRY.</p>
<p><strong>Not All Code Duplication Is Knowledge Duplication</strong></p>
<p>Not All Code Duplication Is Knowledge Duplication As part of your online wine ordering application you’re capturing and
validating your user’s age, along with the quantity they’re ordering. According to the site owner, they should both be
numbers, and both greater than zero. So you code up the validations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def validate_age(value): 
  validate_type(value, :integer) 
  validate_min_integer(value, 0)

def validate_quantity(value): 
  validate_type(value, :integer) 
  validate_min_integer(value, 0)
</code></pre>
<p>The code is the same, but the knowledge they represent is different. The two functions validate two separate things that
just happen to have the same rules. That’s a coincidence, not a duplication.</p>
<h4 id="1-dry-violation-in-documentation">1. DRY Violation in Documentation</h4>
<p>Don't repeat the intent of the function in the comment. Try to write the function and names in a way that it's self
expressing.</p>
<h4 id="2-dry-violation-in-data">2. DRY Violation in Data</h4>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Line {
    Point start;
    Point end;
    double length;
}
</code></pre>
<p>we have duplication. The length is defined by the start and end points: change one of the points and the length changes.
It’s better to make the length a calculated field:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Line {
    Point start;
    Point end;

    double length() {
        return star.distanceTo(end);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>It's OK to violate the DRY principle fo performance reasons. e.g. caching the data.
Where possible, always use accessor functions to read and write the attributes of objects. It will make it easier to add
functionality in the future.</p>
<p><em>All services offered by a module should be available through a uniform notation, which does not betray whether they are
implemented through storage or through computation.</em></p>
<h4 id="2-dry-violation-in-representation">2. DRY Violation in Representation</h4>
<p>Your code needs to know how to communicate with libraries, API or the schemas (e.g. error codes).
The duplication here is that two things (your code and the external entity) have to have knowledge of the representation
of their interface. Change it at one end, and the other end breaks.
Some strategies:
<strong>Duplication across internal API</strong> - look for tools that let you specify the API in some kind of neutral format. These
tools will typically generate documentation, mock APIs, functional tests, and API clients, the latter in a number of
different languages. Ideally the tool will store all your APIs in a central repository, allowing them to be shared
across teams.</p>
<p><strong>Duplication Across External APIs</strong> - Increasingly, you’ll find that public APIs are documented formally using
something like OpenAPI.This allows you to import the API spec into your local API tools and integrate more reliably
with the service. If you can’t find such a specification, consider creating one and publishing it. Not only will others
find it useful; you may even get help maintaining it.</p>
<p><strong>Duplication with Data Sources</strong> - Many data sources allow you to introspect on their data schema. This can be used to
remove much of the duplication between them and your code. Rather than manually creating the code to contain this stored
data, you can generate the containers directly from the schema. Many persistence frameworks will do this heavy lifting
for you.
There’s another option, and one we often prefer. Rather than writing code that represents external data in a
fixed structure (an instance of a struct or class, for example), just stick it into a key/value data structure (your
language might call it a map, hash, dictionary, or even object). On its own this is risky: you lose a lot of the
security of knowing just what data you’re working with. So we recommend adding a second layer to this solution: a simple
table-driven validation suite that verifies that the map you’ve created contains</p>
<p><strong>Inter-developer Duplication</strong> - at the module level, the problem is more insidious. Commonly needed functionality or
data that doesn’t fall into an obvious area of responsibility can get implemented many times over.
We feel that the best way to deal with this is to encourage active and frequent communication between developers. Maybe
run a daily scrum standup meeting. Set up forums (such as Slack channels) to discuss common problems. This provides a
non-intrusive way of communicating—even across multiple sites—while retaining a permanent history of everything said.
Appoint a team member as the project librarian, whose job is to facilitate the exchange of knowledge. Have a central
place in the source tree where utility routines and scripts can be deposited. And make a point of reading other people’s
source code and documentation, either informally or during code reviews. You’re not snooping—you’re learning from them.
And remember, the access is reciprocal—don’t get twisted about other people poring (pawing?) through your code, either.</p>
<h3 id="10-orthogonality">10 Orthogonality</h3>
<p>"Orthogonality" is a term borrowed from geometry. Two lines are orthogonal if they meet at right angles, such as the
axes on a graph. It's generalization of the geometric notion of perpendicularity.
In computing, the term has come to signify a kind of independence or decoupling. Two or more things are
orthogonal if changes in one do not affect any of the others.</p>
<p>We want to design components that are self-contained: independent, and with a single, well-defined purpose (what Yourdon
and Constantine call cohesion in Structured Design: Fundamentals of a Discipline of Computer Program and Systems
Design[YC79]). When components are isolated from one another, you know that you can change one without having to worry
about the rest. As long as you don’t change that component’s external interfaces, you can be confident that you won’t
cause problems that ripple through the entire system.</p>
<p>Two major benefits if you write orthogonal systems:</p>
<ol>
<li>increased productivity - It is easier to write relatively small, self-contained components than a single large block
   of code. Simple components can be designed, coded, tested, and then forgotten—there is no need to keep changing
   existing code as you add new code.</li>
<li>reduced risk - Diseased sections of code are isolated. If a module is sick, it is less likely to spread the symptoms
   around the rest of the system. It is also easier to slice it out and transplant in something new and healthy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most developers are familiar with the need to design orthogonal systems, although they may use words such as modular,
component-based, and layered to describe the process.</p>
<p>Orthogonality is closely related to the DRY principle. With DRY, you’re looking to minimize duplication within a system,
whereas with orthogonality you reduce the interdependency among the system’s components. It may be a clumsy word, but if
you use the principle of orthogonality, combined closely with the DRY principle, you’ll find that the systems you
develop are more flexible, more understandable, and easier to debug, test, and maintain.</p>
<h3 id="11-reversibility">11 Reversibility</h3>
<p>What you can do is make it easy to change. Hide third-party APIs behind your own abstraction layers. Break your code
into components: even if you end up deploying them on a single massive server, this approach is a lot easier than taking
a monolithic application and splitting it.</p>
<h3 id="12-tracer-bullets">12 Tracer Bullets</h3>
<p>the term tracer bullet development is used to visually illustrate the need for immediate feedback under actual
conditions with a moving goal.</p>
<p>Tracer bullets work because they operate in the same environment and under the same constraints as the real bullets.
They get to the target fast, so the gunner gets immediate feedback. And from a practical standpoint they’re a relatively
cheap solution.
Look for the important requirements, the ones that define the system. Look for the areas where you have doubts, and
where you see the biggest risks. Then prioritize your development so that these are the first areas you code.
Tracer code is not disposable: you write it for keeps. It contains all the error checking, structuring, documentation,
and self-checking that any piece of production code has. It simply is not fully functional. However, once you have
achieved an end-to-end connection among the components of your system, you can check how close to the target you are,
adjusting if necessary. Once you’re on target, adding functionality is easy.
Tracer development is consistent with the idea that a project is never finished: there will always be changes required
and functions to add. It is an incremental approach.</p>
<p>The tracer code approach has many advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users get to see something working early - your users will know they are seeing something immature. They won’t be
  disappointed by a lack of functionality; they’ll be ecstatic to see some visible progress toward their system.</li>
<li>Developers build a structure to work in - it. If you have worked out all the end-to-end interactions of your
  application, and have embodied them in code, then your team won’t need to pull as much out of thin air. This makes
  everyone more productive, and encourages consistency.</li>
<li>You have an integration platform - have an integration platform As the system is connected end-to-end, you have an
  environment to which you can add new pieces of code once they have been unit-tested.</li>
<li>You have something to demonstrate</li>
<li>You have a better feel for progress</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tracer Code versus Prototyping</strong>
You might think that this tracer code concept is nothing more than prototyping under an aggressive name. There is a
difference. With a prototype, you’re aiming to explore specific aspects of the final system. With a true prototype, you
will throw away whatever you lashed together when trying out the concept, and recode it properly using the lessons
you’ve learned. The tracer code approach addresses a different problem. You need to know how the application as a whole
hangs together. You want to show your users how the interactions will work in practice, and you want to give your
developers an architectural skeleton on which to hang code.</p>
<h3 id="13-prototypes-and-post-it-notes">13 Prototypes and Post-it Notes</h3>
<p>What sorts of things might you choose to investigate with a prototype?</p>
<ul>
<li>Anything that carries risk.</li>
<li>Anything that hasn’t been tried before,</li>
<li>Anything that is absolutely critical to the final system.</li>
<li>Anything unproven, experimental, or doubtful.</li>
<li>Anything you aren’t comfortable with.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can prototype:</p>
<ul>
<li>Architecture</li>
<li>New functionality in an existing system</li>
<li>Structure or contents of external data</li>
<li>Third-party tools or components</li>
<li>Performance issues</li>
<li>User interface design</li>
</ul>
<p>Prototyping is a learning experience. Its value lies not in the code produced, but in the lessons learned. That’s really
the point of prototyping.</p>
<p><strong>How to Use Prototypes</strong>
When building a prototype, what details can you ignore?</p>
<p><strong>Correctness</strong>
You may be able to use dummy data where appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Completeness</strong>
The prototype may function only in a very limited sense, perhaps with only one preselected piece of input data and one
menu item.</p>
<p><strong>Robustness</strong>
Error checking is likely to be incomplete or missing entirely. If you stray from the predefined path, the prototype may
crash and burn in a glorious display of pyrotechnics. That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>Style</strong>
Prototype code shouldn’t have much in the way of comments or documentation (although you may produce reams of
documentation as a result of your experience with the prototype).</p>
<h3 id="14-domain-languages">14 Domain Languages</h3>
<p>We always try to write code using the vocabulary of the application domain (see Maintain a Glossary). In some cases,
Pragmatic Programmers can go to the next level and actually program using the vocabulary, syntax, and semantics—the
language—of the domain.
E.g. Cucumber is programming-language neutral way of specifying tests. You run the tests using a version of Cucumber
appropriate to the language you’re using. In order to support the natural-language like syntax, you also have to write
specific matchers that recognize phrases and extract parameters for the tests.</p>

<p><strong>Where Do Estimates Come From?</strong>
Ask someone who’s already done it. Before you get too committed to model building, cast around for someone
who’s been in a similar situation in the past. See how their problem got solved.</p>
<p><strong>Understand What’s Being Asked</strong>
You need to have a grasp of the scope of the domain. Often this is implicit in the question, but you need to make it a
habit to think about the scope before starting to guess. Often, the scope you choose will form part of the answer you
give: "Assuming there are no traffic accidents and there’s gas in the car, I should be there in 20 minutes."</p>
<p><strong>Build a Model of the System</strong>
From your understanding of the question being asked, build a rough-and-ready bare-bones mental model.
Building the model introduces inaccuracies into the estimating process. This is inevitable, and also beneficial. You are
trading off model simplicity for accuracy. Doubling the effort on the model may give you only a slight increase in
accuracy. Your experience will tell you when to stop refining.</p>
<p><strong>Break the Model into Components</strong>
Once you have a model, you can decompose it into components. You’ll need to discover the mathematical rules that
describe how these components interact. Sometimes a component contributes a single value that is added into the result.
You’ll find that each component will typically have parameters that affect how it contributes to the overall model. At
this stage, simply identify each parameter.</p>
<p><strong>Give Each Parameter a Value</strong>
Once you have the parameters broken out, you can go through and assign each one a value. You expect to introduce some
errors in this step. The trick is to work out which parameters have the most impact on the result, and concentrate on
getting them about right. Typically, parameters whose values are added into a result are less significant than those
that are multiplied or divided.</p>
<p><strong>Calculate the Answers</strong>
A spreadsheet can be a big help. Then couch your answer in terms of these parameters.
During the calculation phase, you get answers that seem strange. Don’t be too quick to dismiss them. If your arithmetic
is correct, your understanding of the problem or your model is probably wrong. This is valuable information.</p>
<p><strong>Keep Track of Your Estimating Prowess</strong>
We think it’s a great idea to record your estimates, so you can see how close you were. If an overall estimate involved
calculating sub-estimates, keep track of these as well. Often you’ll find your estimates are pretty good—in fact, after
a while, you’ll come to expect this.</p>
<h4 id="estimating-project-schedules-painting-the-missile">Estimating Project Schedules -Painting the Missile</h4>
<p>"How long will it take to paint the house?" "Well, if everything goes right, and this paint has the coverage they claim,
it might be as few as 10 hours. But that’s unlikely: I’d guess a more realistic figure is closer to 18 hours. And, of
course, if the weather turns bad, that could push it out to 30 or more."</p>
<p>That’s how people estimate in the real world. Not with a single number (unless you force them to give you one) but with
a range of scenarios.</p>
<h4 id="what-to-say-when-asked-for-an-estimate">What to Say When Asked for an Estimate</h4>

<li>Insurance against obsolescence - human-readable (and human understandable!) forms of data and self-describing data

<p>Embrace the fact that debugging is just problem-solving and attack it as such.</p>
<p><strong>A debugging mindset</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>don't panic, think about what could be causing the symptoms that you believe indicate a bug.</li>
<li>Before you start to look at the bug make sure that you are working on code that built cleanly - without warnings.</li>
<li>gather all relevant data</li>
<li>talk/interview to reported, go together though the issue if you can't reproduce it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Debugging Strategies</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Failing Test Before Fixing Code</li>
<li>Read the Damn Error Message!</li>
<li>Make sure that you also see incorrect value in the debugger</li>
<li>Jot down notes, when you find a clue and chase it down only to find it didn't pan out - it would be easier to come
   back to where you were before.</li>
<li>If it is an input values problem recreate it on full list and start chopping it.</li>
<li>Use the Binary Chop when going through stack trace to find the root of the issue</li>

<h3 id="22-engineering-daybooks">22 Engineering Daybooks</h3>
<p>We use daybooks to take notes in meetings, to jot down what we’re working on, to note variable values when debugging, to
leave reminders where we put things, to record wild ideas, and sometimes just to doodle.</p>
<p>The daybook has three main benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is more reliable than memory. People might ask “What was the name of that company you called last week
  about the power supply problem?” and you can flip back a page or so and give them the name and number.</li>
<li>It gives you a place to store ideas that aren’t immediately relevant to the task at hand. That way you can continue to
  concentrate on
  what you are doing, knowing that the great idea won’t be forgotten.</li>
<li>It acts as a kind of rubber duck (described here). When you stop to write something down, your brain may switch gears,
  almost as if talking to someone—a great chance to reflect. You may start to make a note and then suddenly realize that
  what you’d just done, the topic of the note, is just plain wrong. There’s an added benefit, too. Occasionally you can
  look back at what you were doing oh-so-many-years-ago and think about the people, the projects, and the awful clothes
  and hairstyles.</li>

<p>If you think that someone code might not live up to your standards, don't trust your code either - no one writes perfect

<h3 id="23-design-by-contract">23 Design by Contract</h3>
<p>DBC - Design By Contract - technique that focuses on documenting the rights and responsibilities of software modules to
ensure program correctness.
What is correct program? One that does no more and no less than it claims to do.
Documenting and verifying that claim is the role of DBC.</p>
<p>Every function does <em>something</em> - Before it starts doing <em>something</em> it might have expectations of the state, and also
it can modify that state.
These expectations and claims are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pre-conditions - what must be true in order for the function to be called (it's the caller responsibility to pass
   good data)</li>
<li>Post-conditions - what function is guaranteed to do. - the state when the function is done.</li>
<li>Class invariants / state - class ensures that <em>this</em> condition is always true from the perspective of a caller.</li>
</ol>
<p>So the contract between the caller and module is:
<em>If all function’s preconditions are met by the caller, the function shall guarantee that all post conditions and
invariants will be true when it completes.</em></p>
<p>If something is not as in contract the remedy is to raise exception.
Or Even better disable the possibility to call the function with wrong values.
E.g. on Android you can use <code>@StringRes</code> which indicates that the Int value needs to come from android resources.
Be strict in what you will accept before you begin, promise as little as possible in return.</p>
<p><strong>Implementing DBC</strong><br/>
Simply enumerating what the input domain range is, what the boundary conditions are, and what the
routine promises to deliver.</p>
<p><strong>Assertions</strong>
you can get much greater benefit by having the compiler check your contract for you. You can partially emulate this in
some languages by using assertions: runtime checks for logical conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Who is responsible for checking the preconditions, the caller or the method being called?</strong><br/>
When DBC is implemented by the language - neither. it's tested behind the scene after caller invokes the method but
before the mother runs. If there is any explicit checking of parameters to be done, it must be performed by the <em>caller</em>
because the method will
never see parameters that violate its precondition. <br/>
For non-supporting DBC languages you need to bracket the called method with preamble and/or post-amble that checks these
assertions.</p>
<p>Consider a program that reads a number from the console, calculates its square root (by calling sqrt), and prints the
result. The sqrt function has a precondition—its argument must not be negative. If the user enters a negative number at
the console, it is up to the calling code to ensure that it never gets passed to sqrt. This calling code has many
options: it could terminate, it could issue a warning and read another number, or it could make the number positive and
append an i to the result returned by sqrt. Whatever its choice, this is definitely not sqrt’s problem. By expressing
the domain of the square root function in the precondition of the sqrt routine, you shift the burden of correctness to
the caller—where it belongs. You can then design the sqrt routine secure in the knowledge that its input will be in
range.</p>
<p>Crashing Early gives you possibility to report more accurate information about the problem.</p>
<h3 id="24-dead-programs-tell-no-lies">24 Dead Programs Tell No Lies</h3>
<p><strong>Catch and release is for fish</strong></p>
<p>avoid using try-catch to catch all possible errors.</p>
<ol>
<li>The application code isn't eclipsed by the error code.</li>
<li>The code is less coupled. If the writer of the method adds another exception our code is subtly out of date. Without
   try catch it's propagated.</li>
</ol>
<p>same—when your code discovers that something that was supposed to be impossible just happened, your program is no longer
viable. Anything it does from this point forward becomes suspect, so terminate it as soon as possible.</p>

<h4 id="tip-39-use-assertions-to-prevent-the-impossible">Tip 39 Use Assertions to prevent the impossible</h4>
<p>In the Java implementation, you can (and should) add a descriptive string:</p>
<pre><code>assert result! = null &amp;&amp; result.size() &gt; 0 : "Empty result from XYZ";
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Don’t use assertions in place of real error handling.</strong> Assertions check for things that should never happen.
Your first line of defense is checking for any possible error, and your second is using assertions to try to detect
those you’ve missed.</p>
<h3 id="26-hot-to-balance-resources">26 Hot to Balance Resources</h3>
<p>The function that allocates a resource should be responsible for deallocating it.
Deallocate resources with LIFO principle.
When allocating the same set of resource in different places in your code, always allocate them in the same order to
avoid deadlock.</p>
<p>There are times when the basic resource allocation pattern just isn’t appropriate. Commonly this is found in programs
that use dynamic data structures. One routine will allocate an area of memory and link it into some larger structure,
where it may stay for some time.</p>
<p>The trick here is to establish a semantic invariant for memory allocation. You need to decide who is responsible for
data in an aggregate data structure. What happens when you deallocate the top-level structure? You have three main
options:</p>
<ol>
<li>The top-level structure is also responsible for freeing any substructures that it contains. These structures then
   recursively delete data they contain, and so on.</li>
<li>The top-level structure is simply deallocated. Any structures that it pointed to (that are not referenced elsewhere)
   are orphaned.</li>
<li>The top-level structure refuses to deallocate itself if it contains any substructures.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="tip-42-always-take-small-steps">Tip 42 Always take small steps</h4>
<p>Always take small, deliberate steps, checking for feedback and adjusting before proceeding. Consider that the rate of
feedback is your speed limit. You never take on a step or a task that’s “too big.”<br/>
What do we mean exactly by feedback?
Anything that independently confirms or disproves your action. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Results in a REPL provide feedback on your understanding of APIs and algorithms</li>
<li>Unit tests provide feedback on your last code change</li>
<li>User demo and conversation provide feedback on features and usability</li>
</ul>
<p>What's a task that's too big? Any task that requires "fortune-telling".
We can only see into the future perhaps one or two steps, maybe a few hours or days at most. From that you can quickly
past educated guess into wild speculation.
When the fortune-telling starts?</p>
<ul>
<li>estimate completion dates months in the future</li>
<li>Plan a design for future maintenance or extendability</li>
<li>Guess user's future needs</li>
<li>Guess future tech availability</li>
</ul>
<p>you should design for future maintenance but only to a point - only as far ahead as you can see.</p>

<h4 id="types-of-coupling">types of coupling:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Train wrecks - chains of method calls</li>
<li>Globalization - the dangers of static things</li>
<li>Inheritance - why subclassing is dangerous</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="train-wrecks">Train wrecks</h5>
<p>We’ve all seen (and probably written) code like this:</p>
<pre><code>public void applyDiscount(customer, order_id, discount) {
    totals = customer
        .orders 
        .find(order_id) 
        .getTotals(); 
    totals.grandTotal = totals.grandTotal - discount;
    totals.discount   = discount;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This chunk of code is traversing five levels of abstraction from customer to total amount.
Ultimately our top-level code has to know that a customer object exposes orders, that the orders have a find method that
takes an order id and returns an order, and that the order object has a totals object which has getters and setters for
grand totals and discounts.
That's a lof of implicit knowledge. But worse, that's a lot of things that cannot change in the future if this code is
to continue to work.
All the cars in a train are coupled together as are all the methods and attributes in a train wreck.</p>
<p>How to fix? use <strong>Tell, don't ask</strong>.</p>
<p>TDA - you shouldn't make decision based on the internal state of an object and then update that object.
It destroys the benefit of encapsulation and in doing so spreads the knowledge of the implementation throughout the
code.</p>
<p>proper solution</p>
<pre><code>public void applyDiscount(customer, order_id, discount) {
    customer
        .findOrder(order_id) 
        .applyDiscount(discount); 
}
</code></pre>
<p>alternative you could try to create <code>applyDiscountToOrder(order_id)</code>, but TDA is just a pattern if you think (or it's
required anyway)
to expose the customer has orders, and we can find it, then it is pragmatic decision.</p>
<p><strong>The Law Of Demeter, LoD</strong> - set of guidelines that help developers keep their functions cleaner and decoupled.</p>
<p>The LoD says that a method defined in a class C should only call:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other instance methods in C</li>
<li>Its parameters</li>
<li>Methods in objects that it creates, both on the stack and in the heap</li>
<li>Global variables</li>
</ul>
<p>simpler recommended version is:
<strong>Don't Chain Method Calls</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">// poor style
val amount = customer.orders.last().totals().amount

// and so is this
val orders = customer.orders
val last = order.last()
val totals = last.totals()
val amount = totals.amount
</code></pre>
<p>Big exception to the one-dot rule: the rule doesn't apply if the things you're chaining are really, really unlikely to
change.
In practice, anything in your application should be considered likely to change. Anything in a third-party library
should be considered volatile, particularly if the maintainers of the library are known to change API between releases.
Libraries that come with the language however are probably pretty stable, and we would be happy with the code such as.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">people.sortBy { it.age }
    .first(10)
    .map { it.name }
</code></pre>
<h5 id="the-evils-of-globalization">The Evils of Globalization</h5>
<p>Globals couple code for many reasons. The most obvious is that a change to the implementation of the global potentially
affects all the code in the system. In practice, of course, the impact is fairly limited; the problem really comes down
to knowing that you’ve found every place you need to change. Global data also creates coupling when it comes to teasing
your code apart.
You’ll see this problem when you’re writing unit tests for code that uses global data. You’ll find yourself writing a
bunch of setup code to create a global environment just to allow your test to run.</p>
<p><strong>If It’s Important Enough to Be Global, Wrap It in an API</strong><br/>
Always use abstraction to represent global data (if you can't avoid having global one), same applies for third-party
library.</p>

<h3 id="29-juggling-the-real-world">29 Juggling the Real World</h3>
<p>Events are everywhere. Some are obvious: a button click, a timer expiring. Other are less so: someone logging in, a line
in a file matching a pattern. But whatever their source, code that’s crafted around events can be more responsive and
better decoupled than its more linear counterpart.</p>
<p>Strategies to handle the events:</p>
<ol>
<li>Finite State Machines</li>
<li>The Observer Pattern</li>
<li>Publish/Subscribe</li>
<li>Reactive Programming and Streams</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="finite-state-machines">Finite State Machines</h4>
<p>State machine is basically just a specification of <em>how</em> to handle events.
It consists of a set of states, one of which is the current state.
For each state we list the events that are significant to that state.
For Each of those event we define new current state of the system.</p>
<p>Stet machines are underused by developers. Though they don't solve all the problems associated with events.</p>
<h4 id="the-observer-pattern">The Observer Pattern</h4>
<p>Observable - source of events
Observers - clients who are interested in those events.</p>
<p>observer registers its interest with the observable typically by passing a reference to a function to be called.</p>
<p>It is particularly prevalent in user interface system where the callbacks are used to inform the application that some
interaction has occurred.
<strong>But it introduces coupling</strong>! also it can introduce performance bottlenecks. (both solved by Publish/Subscribe
pattern).</p>
<h4 id="publishsubscribe">Publish/Subscribe</h4>
<p>it generalizes the observer pattern, at the same time solves the problems of coupling and performance.</p>
<p>We have publishers and subscribers, these are connected via <strong>channels</strong>.
The channels are implemented in a separate body of code: sometimes a library, sometimes a process, and sometimes a
distributed infrastructure. All this implementation detail is hidden from your code.
Every channel has a name. Subscribers register interest in one or more of these named channels, and publishers write
events to them. Unlike the observer pattern, the communication between the publisher and subscriber is handled outside
your code, and is potentially asynchronous.
PubSub modules are provided in language as library.</p>
<p>Compared to the observer pattern, pubsub is a great example of reducing coupling by abstracting up through a shared
interface (the channel). However, it is still basically just a message passing system.</p>
<h4 id="reactive-programming-streams-and-events">Reactive Programming, Streams and Events</h4>
<p>If you’ve ever used a spreadsheet, then you’ll be familiar with reactive programming. If a cell contains a formula which
refers to a second cell, then updating that second cell causes the first to update as well. The values react as the
values they use change.</p>
<p>Streams allow us treat events as if they were a collection of data (list of events which gets longer when new events
arrive).
The beauty of that is that we can treat streams just like any other collection: we can manipulate, combine, filter, and
do all the other data-ish things we know so well. We can even combine event streams and regular collections. And streams
can be <strong>asynchronous</strong>, which means your code gets the opportunity to respond to events as they arrive.
This is a very powerful abstraction: we no longer need to think about time as being something we have to manage. Event
streams unify synchronous and asynchronous processing behind a common, convenient API.</p>
<h3 id="30-transforming-programming">30 Transforming Programming</h3>
<p>We should more often think about programs as being something that transforms inputs into outputs.</p>
<p>This chapter talks about a way we can chain object transformations to get what we want</p>
<pre><code>word
|&gt; all_subsets_longer_than_three_characters() 
|&gt; as_unique_signatures() 
|&gt; find_in_dictionary() 
|&gt; group_by_length()
</code></pre>
<p><em>It’s simply a chain of the transformations needed to meet our requirement, each taking input from the previous
transformation and passing output to the next. That comes about as close to literate code as you can get.</em></p>
<p>But there’s something deeper, too. If your background is object-oriented programming, then your reflexes demand that you
hide data, encapsulating it inside objects. These objects then chatter back and forth, changing each other’s state. This
introduces a lot of coupling, and it is a big reason that OO systems can be hard to change. Tip 50 Don’t Hoard State;
Pass It Around In the transformational model, we turn that on its head. Instead of little pools of data spread all over
the system, think of data as a mighty river, a flow. Data becomes a peer to functionality: a pipeline is a sequence of
code → data → code → data…. The data is no longer tied to a particular group of functions, as it is in a class
definition. Instead, it is free to represent the unfolding progress of our application as it transforms its inputs into
its outputs. This means that we can greatly reduce coupling: a function can be used (and reused) anywhere its parameters
match the output of some other function. Yes, there is still a degree of coupling, but in our experience it’s more
manageable than the OO-style of command and control. And, if you’re using a language with type checking, you’ll get
compile-time warnings when you try to connect two incompatible things.</p>
<p>In Language X Doesn’t Have Pipelines we wrote:</p>
<pre><code>const content = File.read(file_name);
const lines   = find_matching_lines(content, pattern) 
const result  = truncate_lines
</code></pre>
<p>Many people write OO code by chaining together method calls, and might be tempted to write this as something like:</p>
<pre><code>const result = content_of(file_name)
  .find_matching_lines(pattern)
  .truncate_lines() 
</code></pre>
<p>What’s the difference between these two pieces of code? Which do you think we prefer?</p>
<p>Let’s answer the second part first: we prefer the first piece of code.</p>
<p>In the second chunk of code, each step returns an object that implements the next function we call: the object returned
by content_of must implement find_matching_lines,
and so on. This means that the object returned by content_of is coupled to our code. Imagine the requirement changed,
and we have to ignore lines starting with a # character. In the transformation style, that would be easy:</p>
<pre><code>const content = File.read(file_name); 
const no_comments = remove_comments(content) 
const lines = find_matching_lines(no_comments, pattern)
const  result = truncate_lines(lines)
</code></pre>
<p>We could even swap the order of <code>remove_comments</code> and <code>find_matching_lines</code> and it would still work.
But in the chained style, this would be more difficult. Where should our <code>remove_comments</code> method live:
in the object returned by content_of or the object returned by find_matching_lines?
And what other code will we break if we change that object?
This coupling is why the method chaining style is sometimes called a <strong>train wreck</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="31-inheritance-tax">31 Inheritance Tax</h3>
<p>Stop using inheritance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Inheritance is coupling. Not only is the child class coupled to the parent, the parent's parent and so on, but the
  code that uses the child is also coupled to all the ancestors.</li>
<li>using inheritance to build types (relation) tends to create complexity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Better alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interfaces and protocols - Prefer interfaces to express polymorphism instead of inheritance</li>
<li>Delegation - instead of trying to inherit method from some class delegate the work to class that contains the code, by
  injecting particular object instead of inherit from it.</li>
<li>Mixins and traits - allows to share the methods between different objects</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="32-configuration">32 Configuration</h3>
<p>Parametrize your app using external configuration.</p>
<p>Common things you will want to put in configuration data include:</p>
<ul>
<li>credentials for external services (database, third party APIs and so on)</li>
<li>logging levels and destinations</li>
<li>port, ip address, machine, and cluster names the app uses</li>
<li>Environment=specific validation parameters</li>
<li>Externally set parameters, such as tax tares</li>
<li>Site-specific formatting details</li>
<li>License keys</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, anything that you know will have to change that you can express outside your main body of code and slap it
into some configuration bucket.</p>
<p>create thin API to access configuration files and keep it behind a Service
benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>sharing configuration information</li>
<li>Configuration changes ca be made globally</li>
<li>Configuration data can be maintained via a specialized UI</li>
<li><strong>configuration data become dynamic</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>without external configuration your code is not as adaptable or flexible as it could be.
Don't overdo it, not everything should be in config files, focus on most important things.</p>
<h2 id="6-concurrency">6 Concurrency</h2>
<p>definition:<br/>
<em>Concurrency</em> is when the execution of two or more pieces of code <strong>act</strong> as if they run at the same time.<br/>
<em>Parallelism</em> is when they <strong>do</strong> run at the same time.</p>
<p>concurrency is a software mechanism, and parallelism is a hardware concern. If we have multiple processors, either
locally or remotely, then if we can split work out among them, we can reduce the overall time things take.</p>
<h3 id="33-breaking-temporal-coupling">33 Breaking Temporal Coupling</h3>
<p>temporal coupling - coupling in time. Method A must always be called before method B, only one report can be run at a
time, you must wait for the screen to redraw before the button click is received. Tick must happen before tock.
This is not very flexible and not very realistic.</p>
<p>Allowing concurrency and think about decoupling of any time or order dependencies.
Result: systems that are easier to reason about, that potentially respond faster and more reliably.</p>
<h4 id="looking-for-concurrency">Looking for concurrency</h4>
<p>In many projects we'd like to find out what <strong>can</strong> happen at the same time and what <strong>must</strong> in a strict order.
One way to do is by <em>activity diagram</em>.</p>
<p>activity diagram - set of actions (drawn as rounded boxes). The arrow leads an action leads to either:</p>
<ul>
<li>another action (which can start after the first action completes)</li>
<li>thick line called a <em>synchronization bar</em> <br/></li>
</ul>
<p>once all actions leading into a synchronization bar are complete you can then proceed along any arrows leaving the bar,
An action with no arrows leading into it can be started at any time.
Activity diagram is used to maximize parallelism by identifying activities that could be performed in parallel but
aren't.</p>
<p>For instance, we may be writing the software for a robotic piña colada maker.<br/>
We’re told that the steps are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open blender</li>
<li>Open piña colada mix</li>
<li>Put mix in blender</li>
<li>Measure 1/2 cup white rum</li>
<li>Pour in rum</li>
<li>Add 2 cups of ice</li>
<li>Close blender</li>
<li>Liquefy for 1 minute</li>
<li>Open blender</li>
<li>Get glasses</li>
<li>Get pink umbrellas</li>
<li>Serve</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="activity diagram" src="../../resources/images/activity_diagram.png"/></p>
<p>the top-level tasks (1, 2, 4, 10, and 11) can all happen concurrently, up front. Tasks 3, 5, and 6 can happen in
parallel later.
When we look at the activities, we realize that number 8, liquefy, will take a minute. During that time, our bartender
can get the glasses and umbrellas (activities 10 and 11) and probably still have time to serve another customer.</p>

<p>Customer is in restaurant asks server if there is a pie left, he looks, sees in the display that there is one left piece
and
confirms. Customer orders the pie.
Same thing happens on the other side of the restaurant at exact time.
One of the customers will be disappointed.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../resources/images/non_atomic_diner_example.png"/></p>
<p>Both waiters operate concurrently (in real life in parallel).
The problem above is shared state. Both waiters when executes <em>display_case.pie_count()</em> they copy the value from the
display into their own memory. If the value in the display case changes their memory (which is used to make decision) is
now out of date.
Solution? make the operation atomic.</p>
<p>Semaphore is a <em>thing</em> that only one person can own at a time. (lock/unlock claim/release)
In above example it can be used to decide who can access pie case.</p>
<pre><code>case_semaphore.lock() 
 if display_case.pie_count &gt; 0
    promise_pie_to_customer()
    display_case.take_pie()
    give_pie_to_customer()
 end
case_semaphore.unlock() 
</code></pre>
<p>This approach above works and solve mentioned issue, but there is another problem.
This approach as long as every developer will use the semaphore, it that's not the case we are in the same place as
before.</p>
<p><strong>Make the Resource Transactional</strong>
We can centralize that control by checking and getting pie in one call:</p>
<pre><code>def get_pie_if_available()
    @case_semaphore.lock() 
    try {
        if @slices.size &gt; 0
            update_sales_data(:pie) 
            return @slices.shift
        else
            false
        end
        }
    ensue {
         @case_semaphore.unlock()
    }
    end
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Random Failures Are Often Concurrency Issues</strong></p>
<h3 id="35-actors-and-processes">35 Actors and Processes</h3>
<ul>
<li>An <em>actor</em> is an independent virtual processor with its own local (and private) state. Each actor has a mailbox. When
  a
  message appears in the mailbox and the actor is idle, it kicks into life and processes the message. When it finishes
  processing, it processes another message in the mailbox, or, if the mailbox is empty, it goes back to sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p>When processing a message, an actor can create other actors, send messages to other actors that it knows about, and
create a new state that will become the current state when the next message is processed.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>process</em> is typically a more general-purpose virtual processor, often implemented by the operating system to
  facilitate concurrency. Processes can be constrained (by convention) to behave like actors, and that’s the type of
  process we mean here.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actors Can Only Be Concurrent</strong><br/>
There are a few things that you won’t find in the definition of actors:</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s no single thing that’s in control. Nothing schedules what happens next, or orchestrates the transfer of
  information from the raw
  data to the final output.</li>
<li>The only state in the system is held in messages and in the local state of each actor. Messages cannot be examined
  except by being read by their recipient, and local state is inaccessible outside the actor.</li>
<li>All messages are one way—there’s no concept of replying. If you want an actor to return a response, you include your
  own mailbox address in the message you send it, and it will (eventually) send the response as just another message
  to that mailbox.</li>
<li>An actor processes each message to completion, and only processes one message at a time.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, actors
execute concurrently, asynchronously, and share nothing. If you had enough physical processors, you could run an actor
on each. If you have a single processor, then some runtime can handle the switching of context between them. Either way,
the code running in the actors is the same.</p>

<p>Why should you take the risk of messing with something that’s working? <br/>
Well, we can think of several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It may not really be working—it might just look like it is.</li>
<li>The boundary condition you rely on may be just an accident.
  In different circumstances (a different screen resolution, more CPU cores), it might behave differently.</li>
<li>Undocumented behavior may change with the next release of the library. Additional and unnecessary calls make your code
  slower. Additional calls increase the risk of introducing new bugs of their own. For code, you write that others will
  call, the basic principles of good modularization and of hiding implementation behind small, well-documented
  interfaces can all help.</li>

<h3 id="40-refactoring">40 Refactoring</h3>
<p>Software development is like gardening -You plant many things in a garden according to an initial plan and conditions.
Some thrive, others are destined to end up as compost. You may move plantings relative to each other to take advantage
of the interplay of light and shadow, wind and rain. Overgrown plants get split or pruned, and colors that clash may get
moved to more aesthetically pleasing locations. You pull weeds, and you fertilize plantings that are in need of some
extra help. You constantly monitor the health of the garden, and make adjustments (to the soil, the plants, the layout)
as needed.</p>
<p>Refactoring [Fow19] is defined by Martin Fowler as a: disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code,
altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior.</p>
<p><em>Time pressure is often used as an excuse for not refactoring. But this excuse just doesn’t hold up: fail to refactor
now, and there’ll be a far greater time investment to fix the problem down the road—when there are more dependencies to
reckon with. Will there be more time available then? Nope.</em></p>
<p>When explaining think of the code that needs refactoring as "a growth." Removing it requires invasive surgery. You can
go in now, and take it out while it is still small. Or, you could wait while it grows and spreads—but removing it then
will be both more expensive and more dangerous. Wait even longer, and you may lose the patient entirely.</p>
<p>Martin Fowler offers the following simple tips on how to refactor without doing more harm than good:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t try to refactor and add functionality at the same time.</li>
<li>Make sure you have good tests before you begin refactoring. Run the tests as often as possible. That way you will
   know quickly if your changes have broken anything.</li>
<li>Take short, deliberate steps:<ul>
<li>move a field from one class to another,</li>
<li>split a method,</li>
<li>rename a variable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Refactoring often involves making many localized changes that result in a larger-scale change. If you keep your
steps small, and test after each step, you will avoid prolonged debugging.</p>
<h3 id="41-test-to-code">41 Test to Code</h3>
<p><em>We believe that the major benefits of testing happen when you think about and write the tests, not when you run them.</em></p>
<p>Why? Because it allows you to understand the under the hood requirements of feature (e.g. parameters)</p>
<p>Use TDD, but avoid:</p>
<ul>
<li>They spend inordinate amounts of time ensuring that they always have 100% test coverage.</li>
<li>They have lots of redundant tests. For example, before writing a class for the first time, many TDD adherents will
  first write a failing test that simply references the class’s name. It fails, then they write an empty class
  definition, and it passes. But now you have
  a test that does absolutely nothing; the next test you write will also reference the class, and so it makes the first
  unnecessary. There’s more stuff to change if the class name changes later. And this is just a trivial example.</li>
<li>Their designs tend to start at the bottom and work their way up. (TIP 68, Build End-to-End, Not Top-Down or Bottom Up)</li>
</ul>
<p>Build small pieces of end-to-end functionality, learning about the problem as you go. Apply this learning as you
continue to flesh out the code, involve the customer at each step, and have them guide the process.</p>
<p>The basic cycle of TDD is: Decide on a small piece of functionality you want to add. Write a test that will pass once
that functionality is implemented. Run all tests. Verify that the only failure is the one you just wrote. Write the
smallest amount of code needed to get the test to pass, and verify that the tests now run cleanly. Refactor your code:
see if there is a way to improve on what you just wrote (the test or the function). Make sure the tests still pass when
you’re done. The idea is that this cycle should be very short: a matter of minutes, so that you’re constantly writing
tests and then getting them to work.</p>
<h3 id="42-property-based-testing">42 Property-Based Testing</h3>
<p>invariants, things that remain true about some piece of state when it’s passed through a function. For example, if you
sort a list, the result will have the same number of elements as the original—the length is invariant.</p>
<h4 id="tip-use-property-based-tests-to-validate-your-assumptions">Tip Use property based tests to validate your assumptions</h4>
<p>There are also code invariants, things that remain true about some piece of state when it’s passed through a function.
For example, if you sort a list, the result will have the same number of elements as the original—the length is
invariant. Once we work out our contracts and invariants (which we’re going to lump together and call properties) we can
use them to automate our testing. What we end up doing is called property-based testing.</p>

<li>Client: How so? You: Well, let’s say they buy a book for $25, and then select overnight shipping, the most expensive
  option. That’ll likely be about $30, making the
  whole order $55. We’d then make the shipping free, and they’d get overnight shipping on a $25 book for just $25._</li>

<p>team has to support the <strong>no broken window</strong> (those small imperfections that no one fixes) mentality.
Also be stayed alerted to avoid being <strong>Boiled Frogs</strong>. It’s even easier for teams as a whole to get boiled. People
assume that someone else is handling an issue, or that the team leader must have OK’d a change that your user is
requesting. Even the best-intentioned teams can be oblivious to significant changes in their projects.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate Team Presence</strong> - team needs to communicate with the rest of the organization.
To outsiders, the worst project teams are those that appear sullen and reticent. They hold meetings with no structure,
where no one wants to talk. Their emails and project documents are a mess: no two look the same, and each uses different
terminology.</p>
<p>There is a simple marketing trick that helps teams communicate as one: generate a brand. When you start a project, come
up with a name for it, ideally something off-the-wall. (In the past, we’ve named projects after things such as killer
parrots that prey on sheep, optical illusions, gerbils, cartoon characters, and mythical cities.) Spend 30 minutes
coming up with a zany logo, and use it. Use your team’s name liberally when talking with people. It sounds silly, but it
gives your team an identity to build on, and the world something memorable to associate with your work.</p>
<p>Organize Fully Functional Teams - That means that you need all the skills to do that within the team: frontend, UI/UX,
server, DBA, QA, etc.
It allows to build end-to-end functionality in small pieces.</p>

now, but now. For many teams and organizations, continuous delivery feels like a lofty, unattainable goal, especially if
you’re saddled with a process that restricts delivery to months, or even weeks. But as with any goal, the key is to keep
aiming in the right direction.</p>

<li>Make sure everyone on the team is totally clear about these expectations.</li>
<li>When making decisions, think about which path forward moves closer to those expectations.</li>
<li>Critically analyze the user requirements in light of the expectations. On many projects we’ve discovered that the
  stated "requirement" was in fact just a guess at what could be
  done by technology: it was actually an amateur implementation plan dressed up as a requirements document. Don’t be
  afraid to make suggestions that change the requirement if you can demonstrate that they will move the project closer
  to
  the objective.</li>
<li>Continue to think about these expectations as you progress through the project.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="53-pride-and-prejudice">53 Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p>You shouldn’t jealously defend your code against interlopers; by the same token, you should treat other people’s code
with respect. The Golden Rule ("Do unto others as you would have them do unto you") and a foundation of mutual respect
among the developers is critical to make this tip work.
We want to see pride of ownership. "I wrote this, and I stand behind my work." Your signature should come to be
recognized as an indicator of quality. People should see your name on a piece of code and expect it to be solid, well
written, tested, and documented. A really professional job. Written by a professional.</p>
<h2 id="10-postface">10 Postface</h2>
<p>Many non-embedded systems can also do both great good and great harm. Social media can promote peaceful revolution or
foment ugly hate. Big data can make shopping easier, and it can destroy any vestige of privacy you might think you have.
Banking systems make loan decisions that change people’s lives. And just about any system can be used to snoop on its
users. We’ve seen hints of the possibilities of a utopian future, and examples of unintended consequences leading to
nightmare dystopia. The difference between the two outcomes might be more subtle than you think. And it’s all in your
hands.</p>
<p>We have a duty to ask ourselves two questions about every piece of code we deliver:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have I protected the user?</li>
<li>Would I use this myself?</li>
