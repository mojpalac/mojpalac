# Grip

### Forehand

put the racket on the ground, and pick it up - done
position - (around) 45 degree to baseline
when finished stroke - then right elbow is pointing to the other side (of the net)

### Backhand

pick the racket vertical to the ground (90 degree from Forehand) - continental grip
when finished stroke - left elbow is pointing to the other side (of the net) and you need to rotate with the shoot

### Switching Grip

switching grip should be done from the beginning (otherwise your learning wrong/harder/more prone to the injures way)

# Serving

1. continental grip
2. position - perpendicularly to the court
3. ball in hand with palms facing sky
4. trophy position
5. Ball thrown little upfront

# Volley

don't do windshield wipers
don't use forehand grip, use continental grip
don't swing (freeze the racket), just let the ball bounce

# Overhead

similarly to serving, side stand - not facing the net

# Rally

sequence of back and forth shots between players, within a point.
A rally starts with the serve and the return of the serve, followed by continuous return shots until a point is scored
which ends the rally.

# Field

baseline - line from which you are serving
service line - line that form square with net
