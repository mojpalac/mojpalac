# JustEatTakeaway Ideas

## Team/Project
- daily stability meeting, why it's needed, do we have any hooks that check for anomaly?
- ways of working:
  - tools (communication), confluence, 
  - definition of ready, definition of done 
- JIRA no preview/code available when typing a comment
- change log for each release? - it is in confluence


## Android

- linking JIRA ticket in github
- why we need firebase, snagbug && kibana. Can we remove any of this, why one is better than another?
- moving away from DataBinding and using ViewBinding
- project structure guides & rules (architecture, naming convention, tooling)
- storing amounts as float's
- how are we tag/version past releases (to retrieve them when needed)
- squash commits when merging to main for simpler commit history
- build time on CI + cost?



## proposed already
- assigning reviewers instead of "FFA". 
  - proposed: mixed feeling across developers - Anfan & Anna were happy about it, but rest not necessary.
