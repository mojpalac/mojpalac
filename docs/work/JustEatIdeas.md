# JustEatTakeaway Ideas

## Team/Project
- daily stability meeting, why it's needed, do we have any hooks that check for anomaly?
- ways of working (tools (communication, ) , definition of ready, definition of done
- communication tools
- JIRA no preview/code available 

## Android

- why we need firebase, snagbug && kibana. Can we remove any of this, why one is better than another?
- moving away from DataBinding and using ViewBinding
- project structure guides & rules (architecture, naming convention, tooling)
